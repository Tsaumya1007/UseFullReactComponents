# UseFullReactComponents
This repository contains useful React components that can help creators build new projects without worrying about developing specific features from scratch.

## For example 

Above you can see CodeSnippetWithAPI dir where you can find "CodeSnippetWithAPI" react component that dynamically fetches data from an API and displays it inside a syntax-highlighted code block. It allows users to edit the fetched code and copy it to the clipboard.

## How to Add in your Project 

1. Install react-syntax-highlighter:
   ```sh
   npm install react-syntax-highlighter
2. Create a CodeSnippetWithAPI Component and add code of CodeSnippetWithAPI
3. Use the Component in Your Project and pass API as props:
   ```sh
   <CodeSnippetWithAPI url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1" />
thats all

This is just one example—there are many React components available that you can utilize in your project.

# I also encourage you to share any new React component ideas you have—feel free to add them!
